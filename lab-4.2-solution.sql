--- 5.4 Determine the number of distinct last names of the actors in the database.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sa.last_name)
FROM sakila.actor as sa;

ORDER BY sf.length desc
LIMIT 10;

-- 7.  Use filtering techniques in order to:

SELECT * FROM sakila.actor as sa
WHERE sa.first_name = 'SCARLETT';

-- *Hint: use `LIKE` operator. [More information here.](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp)* 
SELECT * FROM sakila.film as sf
WHERE (sf.title LIKE '%ARMAGEDDON%' and length >100);

-- 7.3 Determine the number of films that include Behind the Scenes content
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT film_id) 
FROM sakila.film as sf
